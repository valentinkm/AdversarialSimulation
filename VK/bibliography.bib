	abstract = {The social and behavioral sciences have taken a substantial reputational hit over the past decade. Some highly publicized findings have failed to replicate—and those that do replicate often do so with much smaller effect sizes (Camerer et al., 2018; Nosek et al., 2021). Plus some highly touted “science-based” interventions have failed to produce promised positive social change—even when massive efforts are dedicated to making them work (Singal, 2021). This chapter will lay out our two-tiered hypothesis: (a) the ideological homogeneity of the social sciences has entrenched certain scientific orthodoxies and taboos; (b) these orthodoxies and taboos have protected weak ideas from rigorous scrutiny and contributed to the replication crisis. We also explain how open science practices, although a big step in the right direction, leave many researcher degrees of freedom on the table that can bias methodological decisions and research conclusions. We argue that adversarial collaborations are the next necessary science reform for addressing lingering weaknesses in social scientific norms and can further minimize false positives, expedite scientific corrections, stimulate progress for stalemated scientific debates, and ultimately improve the quality of social scientific outputs.},

As with other empirical studies, the success of simulation studies hinges on the quality of their design, execution, and reporting. If not conducted carefully and transparently, their conclusions may be misleading. In this paper, we discuss various questionable research practices, which may impact the validity of simulation studies, some of which cannot be detected or prevented by the current publication process in statistics journals. To illustrate our point, we invent a novel prediction method with no expected performance gain and benchmark it in a preregistered comparative simulation study. We show how easy it is to make the method appear superior over well-established competitor methods if questionable research practices are employed. Finally, we provide concrete suggestions for researchers, reviewers, and other academic stakeholders for improving the methodological quality of comparative simulation studies, such as preregistering simulation protocols, incentivizing neutral simulation studies, and code and data sharing.},

As an approach to research, adversarial collaboration sits squarely within the open science framework because it puts a premium on transparency in hypothesis specification, study design, data analysis, study interpretation and reporting, and supplies a framework that can encourage rigour in these components of the research process. It is, however, far less common than many other open science innovations such as open materials and data sharing or study preregistration. Therefore, this chapter will begin by familiarising readers with adversarial collaboration, outlining some of its key features, and identifying potential benefits of the approach.

The approach requires both parties to agree on empirical tests for resolving a dispute and to conduct these tests with the help of an arbiter. In dispute were Hertwig's claims that frequency formats eliminate conjunction effects and that the conjunction effects previously reported by Kahneman and Tversky occurred because some participants interpreted the word “and” in “bank tellers and feminists” as a union operator. Hertwig proposed two new conjunction phrases, “and are” and “who are,” that would eliminate the ambiguity. Kahneman disagreed with Hertwig's predictions for “and are,” but agreed with his predictions for “who are.” Mellers served as arbiter. Frequency formats by themselves did not eliminate conjunction effects with any of the phrases, but when filler items were removed, conjunction effects disappeared with Hertwig's phrases. Kahneman and Hertwig offer different interpretations of the findings. We discuss the benefits of adversarial collaboration over replies and rejoinders, and present a suggested protocol for adversarial collaboration.},

We derive general good practice principles and three 20-item checklists aimed at Strengthening The Reporting of Empirical Simulation Studies ({STRESS}): {STRESS}-{DES}, {STRESS}-{ABS} and {STRESS}-{SD} for discrete-event simulation, agentbased simulation and system dynamics, respectively.

A key strength of simulation studies is the ability to understand the behavior of statistical methods because some “truth” (usually some parameter/s of interest) is known from the process of generating the data. This allows us to consider properties of methods, such as bias. While widely used, simulation studies are often poorly designed, analyzed, and reported. This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (“{ADEMP}”); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations. With a view to describing recent practice, we review 100 articles taken from Volume 34 of Statistics in Medicine, which included at least one simulation study and identify areas for improvement.},

            Improving the reliability and efficiency of scientific research will increase the credibility of the published scientific literature and accelerate discovery. Here we argue for the adoption of measures to optimize key elements of the scientific process: methods, reporting and dissemination, reproducibility, evaluation and incentives. There is some evidence from both simulations and empirical studies supporting the likely effectiveness of these measures, but their broad adoption by researchers, institutions, funders and journals will require iterative evaluation and improvement. We discuss the goals of these measures, and how they can be implemented, in the hope that this will facilitate action toward improving the transparency, reproducibility and efficiency of scientific research.},

	url = {https://osf.io/frmnx},
	abstract = {Computer simulations have become one of the most prominent tools for methodologists in the social sciences to evaluate the properties of their statistical techniques and to offer best practice recommendations. Amongst the many uses of computer simulations, evaluating the robustness of methods to their assumptions, particularly univariate or multivariate normality, is crucial to ensure the appropriateness of data analysis. In order to accomplish this, quantitative researchers need to be able to generate data where they have a degree of control over its non-normal properties. Even though great advances have been achieved in statistical theory and computational power, the task of simulating multivariate, non-normal data is not straightforward. There are inherent conceptual and mathematical complexities implied by the phrase ``non-normality'' which are not always reflected in the simulations studies conduced by social scientists. The present article attempts to offer a summary of some of the issues concerning the simulation of multivariate, non-normal data in the social sciences. An overview of common algorithms is presented as well as some of the characteristics and idiosyncrasies that implied in them which may exert undue influence in the results of simulation studies. A call is made to encourage the meta-scientific study of computer simulations in the social sciences in order to understand how simulation designs frame the teaching, usage and practice of statistical techniques within the social sciences.},

	abstract = {For simulation studies on the exploratory factor analysis ({EFA}), usually rather simple population models are used without model errors. In the present study, real data characteristics are used for Monte Carlo simulation studies. Real large data sets are examined and the results of {EFA} on them are taken as the population models. First we apply a resampling technique on these data sets with sub samples of different sizes. Then, a Monte Carlo study is conducted based on the parameters of the population model and with some variations of them. Two data sets are analyzed as an illustration. Results suggest that outcomes of simulation studies are always highly influenced by particular specification of the model and its violations. Once small residual correlations appeared in the data for example, the ranking of our methods changed completely. The analysis of real data set characteristics is therefore important to understand the performance of different methods.},

In the best case, authors may provide their source code as a compressed archive and they may feel confident their research is reproducible. But this is not exactly true. James Buckheit and David Donoho proposed more than two decades ago that an article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code, and data that produced the result. This implies new workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely requested and are hardly ever actually executed to check that they produce the results advertised in the article. {ReScience} is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research can be replicated from its description. To achieve this goal, the whole publishing chain is radically different from other traditional scientific journals. {ReScience} resides on {GitHub} where each new implementation of a computational study is made available together with comments, explanations, and software tests.},

	abstract = {Computer science offers a large set of tools for prototyping, writing, running, testing, validating, sharing and reproducing results, however computational science lags behind. In the best case, authors may provide their source code as a compressed archive and they may feel confident their research is reproducible. But this is not exactly true. James Buckheit and David Donoho proposed more than two decades ago that an article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code, and data that produced the result. This implies new workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely requested, hardly ever actually executed to check that they produce the results advertised in the article. {ReScience} is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research can be replicated from its description. To achieve this goal, the whole publishing chain is radically different from other traditional scientific journals. {ReScience} resides on {GitHub} where each new implementation of a computational study is made available together with comments, explanations, and software tests.},

	abstract = {Results of simulation studies evaluating the performance of statistical methods are often considered actionable and thus can have a major impact on the way empirical research is implemented. However, so far there is limited evidence about the reproducibility and replicability of statistical simulation studies. Therefore, eight highly cited statistical simulation studies were selected, and their replicability was assessed by teams of replicators with formal training in quantitative methodology. The teams found relevant information in the original publications and used it to write simulation code with the aim of replicating the results. The primary outcome was the feasibility of replicability based on reported information in the original publications. Replicability varied greatly: Some original studies provided detailed information leading to almost perfect replication of results, whereas other studies did not provide enough information to implement any of the reported simulations. Replicators had to make choices regarding missing or ambiguous information in the original studies, error handling, and software environment. Factors facilitating replication included public availability of code, and descriptions of the data-generating procedure and methods in graphs, formulas, structured text, and publicly accessible additional resources such as technical reports. Replicability of statistical simulation studies was mainly impeded by lack of information and sustainability of information sources. Reproducibility could be achieved for simulation studies by providing open code and data as a supplement to the publication. Additionally, simulation studies should be transparently reported with all relevant information either in the research paper itself or in easily accessible supplementary material to allow for replicability.},

            Most research articles presenting new data analysis methods claim that “the new method performs better than existing methods,” but the veracity of such statements is questionable. Our manuscript discusses and illustrates consequences of the optimistic bias occurring during the evaluation of novel data analysis methods, that is, all biases resulting from, for example, selection of datasets or competing methods, better ability to fix bugs in a preferred method, and selective reporting of method variants. We quantitatively investigate this bias using an example from epigenetic analysis: normalization methods for data generated by the Illumina {HumanMethylation}450K {BeadChip} microarray.},

The performance of statistical methods that are used for analyzing empirical data can be evaluated and compared using computer simulations. A single simulation study can influence the analyses of thousands of empirical studies to follow. With great power comes great responsibility. Here, we argue that this responsibility includes replication of simulation studies to ensure a sound foundation for data analytical decisions. Furthermore, being designed, run, and reported by humans, simulation studies face challenges similar to other experimental empirical research and hence should not be exempt from replication attempts. We highlight that the potential replicability of simulation studies is an opportunity quantitative methodology as a field should pay more attention to.},

	abstract = {Computer simulations have become one of the most prominent tools for methodologists in the social sciences to evaluate the properties of their statistical techniques and to offer best practice recommendations. Amongst the many uses of computer simulations, evaluating the robustness of methods to their assumptions, particularly univariate or multivariate normality, is crucial to ensure the appropriateness of data analysis. In order to accomplish this, quantitative researchers need to be able to generate data where they have a degree of control over its non-normal properties. Even though great advances have been achieved in statistical theory and computational power, the task of simulating multivariate, non-normal data is not straightforward. There are inherent conceptual and mathematical complexities implied by the phrase "non-normality" which are not always reflected in the simulations studies conduced by social scientists. The present article attempts to offer a summary of some of the issues concerning the simulation of multivariate, non-normal data in the social sciences. An overview of common algorithms is presented as well as some of the characteristics and idiosyncrasies that implied in them which may exert undue influence in the results of simulation studies. A call is made to encourage the meta-scientific study of computer simulations in the social sciences in order to understand how simulation designs frame the teaching, usage and practice of statistical techniques within the social sciences.},

Simulation studies can play a vital role in improving the efficiency of the drug development process within the pharmaceutical industry, but only if they are well designed and conducted.
            It is imperative therefore that a protocol or simulation plan is developed, documenting how the simulation study is to be conducted, analysed and reported. This article emphasises the specific considerations necessary for designing good quality simulation studies. These include defining data generation processes, data analytic methods, decision criteria and also determining the presentation of results for all intended audiences.
            With clinical trial simulations becoming a vital part of the drug development process, the protocol for clinical trial simulations may in future become part of the regulatory peer review process.

	abstract = {Simulation studies allow us to explore the properties of statistical methods. They provide a powerful tool with a multiplicity of aims; among others: evaluating and comparing new or existing statistical methods, assessing violations of modelling assumptions, helping with the understanding of statistical concepts, and supporting the design of clinical trials. The increased availability of powerful computational tools and usable software has contributed to the rise of simulation studies in the current literature. However, simulation studies involve increasingly complex designs, making it difficult to provide all relevant results clearly. Dissemination of results plays a focal role in simulation studies: it can drive applied analysts to use methods that have been shown to perform well in their settings, guide researchers to develop new methods in a promising direction, and provide insights into less established methods. It is crucial that we can digest relevant results of simulation studies. Therefore, we developed {INTEREST}: an {INteractive} Tool for Exploring {REsults} from Simulation {sTudies}. The tool has been developed using the Shiny framework in R and is available as a web app or as a standalone package. It requires uploading a tidy format dataset with the results of a simulation study in R, Stata, {SAS}, {SPSS}, or comma-separated format. A variety of performance measures are estimated automatically along with Monte Carlo standard errors; results and performance summaries are displayed both in tabular and graphical fashion, with a wide variety of available plots. Consequently, the reader can focus on simulation parameters and estimands of most interest. In conclusion, {INTEREST} can facilitate the investigation of results from simulation studies and supplement the reporting of results, allowing researchers to share detailed results from their simulations and readers to explore them freely.},

A primary goal of this article is to demonstrate how well-suited {MCS} designs are to classroom demonstrations, and how they provide a hands-on method for students to become acquainted with complex statistical concepts. In this article, essential programming aspects for writing {MCS} code in R are overviewed, multiple applied examples with relevant code are provided, and the benefits of using a generate–analyze–summarize coding structure over the typical “for-loop” strategy are discussed.},

Social support is one of the most critical predictors of cross-cultural adjustment. Nevertheless, the nuances and interaction of diverse sources and types of support in the expatriates’ social networks need further scrutiny. This study examines the distinct and collaborative role of four different social groups in the expatriates’ social network, specifically host country nationals, home country nationals, compatriots, and foreign expatriates, on expatriate adjustment. For that purpose, an exploratory qualitative approach was adopted by using a diary study. The study was conducted with 42 single expatriates working in 21 different countries. The results showed that the nature of support provided by each social group was distinct, contributing to expatriate adjustment via different mechanisms. Moreover, it was found that these mechanisms worked collaboratively toward facilitating the expatriate adjustment.},

This article presents a diary study of 54 master’s students conducting group projects across four semesters. A total of 332 diary entries were analysed using the C5 model of collaboration that incorporates elements of communication, contribution, coordination, cooperation and collaboration. Quantitative and qualitative analyses show how these elements relate to one another for students working on collaborative projects. It was found that face-to-face communication related positively with satisfaction and group dynamics, whereas online chat correlated positively with feedback and closing the gap. Managing scope was perceived to be the most common challenge. The findings suggest the varying affordances and drawbacks of different methods of communication, collaborative work styles and the strategies of group members.},

We review the types of research questions that diary methods are best equipped to answer, the main designs that can be used, current technology for obtaining diary reports, and appropriate data analysis strategies. Major recent developments include the use of electronic forms of data collection and multilevel models in data analysis. We identify several areas of research opportunities: 1. in technology, combining electronic diary reports with collateral measures such as ambulatory heart rate; 2. in measurement, switching from measures based on between-person differences to those based on within-person changes; and 3. in research questions, using diaries to (a) explain why people differ in variability rather than mean level, (b) study change processes during major events and transitions, and (c) study interpersonal processes using dyadic and group diary methods.},

It is usually treated as an interval scale, but strictly speaking it is an ordinal scale, where arithmetic operations cannot be conducted. There are pros and cons in using the Likert scale as an interval scale, but the controversy can be handled by increasing the number of points. Several researchers have suggested bringing the number up to eleven, on the basis of empirical data. In this article the authors explore this rational and share the same view, but simulate artificial data from both symmetrical normal and skewed distributions where the underlying metric is known in advance. Results show that more Likert scale points will result in a closer approach to the underlying distribution, and hence normality and interval scales. To increase generalizability social work practitioners are encouraged to use 11-point Likert scales from 0 to 10, a natural and easily comprehensible range.},

We find that many articles do not provide complete and transparent information about key aspects of the study, such as justifications for the number of simulation repetitions, Monte Carlo uncertainty estimates, or code and data to reproduce the simulation studies. To address this problem, we provide a summary of the {ADEMP} (Aims, Data-generating mechanism, Estimands and other targets, Methods, Performance measures) design and reporting framework from Morris, White, and Crowther (2019) adapted to simulation studies in psychology. Based on this framework, we provide {ADEMP}-{PreReg}, a step-by-step template for researchers to use when designing, potentially preregistering, and reporting their simulation studies. We give formulae for estimating common performance measures, their Monte Carlo standard errors, and for calculating the number of simulation repetitions to achieve a desired Monte Carlo standard error. Finally, we give a detailed tutorial on how to apply the {ADEMP} framework in practice using an example simulation study on the evaluation of methods for the analysis of pre–post measurement experiments.},

	abstract = {Scholarly communication is in a perpetual state of disruption. Within this, peer review of research articles remains an essential part of the formal publication process, distinguishing it from virtually all other modes of communication. In the last several years, there has been an explosive wave of innovation in peer review research, platforms, discussions, tools and services. This is largely coupled with the ongoing and parallel evolution of scholarly communication as it adapts to rapidly changing environments, within what is widely considered as the ‘open research’ or ‘open science’ movement. Here, we summarise the current ebb and flow around changes to peer review and consider its role in a modern digital research and communications infrastructure and suggest why uptake of new models of peer review appears to have been so low compared to what is often viewed as the ‘traditional’ method of peer review. Finally, we offer some insight into the potential futures of scholarly peer review and consider what impacts this might have on the broader scholarly research ecosystem. In particular, we focus on the key traits of certification and reputation, moderation and quality control and engagement incentives, and discuss how these interact with socio-technical aspects of peer review and academic culture.},

	title = {Many Labs 5: Testing Pre-Data-Collection Peer Review as an Intervention to Increase Replicability},
	abstract = {Replication studies in psychological science sometimes fail to reproduce prior findings. If these studies use methods that are unfaithful to the original study or ineffective in eliciting the phenomenon of interest, then a failure to replicate may be a failure of the protocol rather than a challenge to the original finding. Formal pre-data-collection peer review by experts may address shortcomings and increase replicability rates. We selected 10 replication studies from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology ({RP}:P; Open Science Collaboration, 2015) for which the original authors had expressed concerns about the replication designs before data collection; only one of these studies had yielded a statistically significant effect (p {\textless} .05). Commenters suggested that lack of adherence to expert review and lowpowered tests were the reasons that most of these {RP}:P studies failed to replicate the original effects. We revised the replication protocols and received formal peer review prior to conducting new replication studies. We administered the {RP}:P and revised protocols in multiple laboratories (median number of laboratories per original study = 6.5, range = 3–9; median total sample = 1,279.5, range = 276–3,512) for high-powered tests of each original finding with both protocols. Overall, following the preregistered analysis plan, we found that the revised protocols produced effect sizes similar to those of the {RP}:P protocols (Δr = .002 or .014, depending on analytic approach). The median effect size for the revised protocols (r = .05) was similar to that of the {RP}:P protocols (r = .04) and the original {RP}:P replications (r = .11), and smaller than that of the original studies (r = .37). Analysis of the cumulative evidence across the original studies and the corresponding three replication attempts provided very precise estimates of the 10 tested effects and indicated that their effect sizes (median r = .07, range = .00–.15) were 78\% smaller, on average, than the original effect sizes (median r = .37, range = .19–.50).},

              The history of science includes numerous challenging problems, including the “hard problem” (
              1
              ) of consciousness: Why does an assembly of neurons—no matter how complex, such as the human brain—give rise to perceptions and feelings that are consciously experienced, such as the sweetness of chocolate or the tenderness of a loving caress on one's cheek? Beyond satisfying this millennia-old existential curiosity, understanding consciousness bears substantial medical and ethical implications, from evaluating whether someone is conscious after brain injury to determining whether nonhuman animals, fetuses, cell organoids, or even advanced machines (
              2
              ) are conscious. A comprehensive and agreed-upon theory of consciousness is necessary to answer the question of which systems—biologically evolved or artificially designed—experience anything and to define the ethical boundaries of our actions toward them. The research projects described here will hopefully point the way and indicate whether some of today's major theories hold water or not.},

	abstract = {Behavioral and social scientists have long enjoyed vast discretion in data-analysis choices. This permissive regime has enabled scholars to engage in many deceptive analytic techniques that facilitated false claims and undercut the ﬁeld’s collective credibility. Recent adoption of new transparency norms has slowed these trends and has shed light on the nonreplicability of many once-prominent empirical ﬁndings. But these transparency norms lack means of constraining researchers’ ﬂexibility to cherry-pick how they deﬁne their variables and design their empirical tests that make it easier for scholars to support their preferred hypotheses. This freedom continues to facilitate false claims in the social and behavioral sciences and enables contradictory conclusions to persist for decades with little to no convergence. We propose that adversarial collaborations, which call on disagreeing scientists to codevelop tests of their competing hypotheses, are a vital supplement to current scientiﬁc norms for improving science’s capacity for self-correction. Adversarial collaborations disincentivize performative research aimed at like-minded colleagues, instead favoring intense intellectual competition designed to winnow false claims. We explain why it is in the best interests of the research community to incorporate adversarial collaboration as a routine component of science.},

	abstract = {There are few examples of an extended adversarial collaboration, in which investigators committed to different theoretical views collaborate to test opposing predictions. Whereas previous adversarial collaborations have produced single research articles, here, we share our experience in programmatic, extended adversarial collaboration involving three laboratories in different countries with different theoretical views regarding working memory, the limited information retained in mind, serving ongoing thought and action. We have focused on short-term memory retention of items (letters) during a distracting task (arithmetic), and effects of aging on these tasks. Over several years, we have conducted and published joint research with preregistered predictions, methods, and analysis plans, with replication of each study across two laboratories concurrently. We argue that, although an adversarial collaboration will not usually induce senior researchers to abandon favored theoretical views and adopt opposing views, it will necessitate varieties of their views that are more similar to one another, in that they must account for a growing, common corpus of evidence. This approach promotes understanding of others’ views and presents to the field research findings accepted as valid by researchers with opposing interpretations. We illustrate this process with our own research experiences and make recommendations applicable to diverse scientific areas.},

In this tutorial, we demonstrate how the R package repro supports researchers in creating fully computationally reproducible research projects with tools from the software engineering community. Building upon this notion of fully automated reproducibility, we present several applications including the preregistration of research plans with code (Preregistration as Code, {PAC}). {PAC} eschews all ambiguity of traditional preregistration and offers several more advantages.

The t-test is one of the most prevalent tests used in the medical field and is the uniformally most powerful unbiased test ({UMPU}) under normal curve theory. But does it maintain its {UMPU} properties when assumptions of normality are violated? A Monte Carlo investigation evaluates the comparative power of the independent samples t-test and its nonparametric counterpart, the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum ({WRS}) test, to violations from population normality, using three commonly occurring distributions and small sample sizes. The t-test was more powerful under relatively symmetric distributions, although the magnitude of the differences was moderate. Under distributions with extreme skews, the {WRS} held large power advantages. When distributions consist of heavier tails or extreme skews, the {WRS} should be the test of choice. In turn, when population characteristics are unknown, the {WRS} is recommended, based on the magnitude of these power differences in extreme skews, and the modest variation in symmetric distributions.},

	abstract = {Structural equation models ({SEM}), or confirmatory factor analysis as a special case, contain model parameters at the measurement part and the structural part. In most social-science {SEM} applications, all parameters are simultaneously estimated in a one-step approach (e.g., with maximum likelihood estimation). In a recent article, Rosseel and Loh (2022, Psychol. Methods) proposed a two-step structural after measurement ({SAM}) approach to {SEM} that estimates the parameters of the measurement model in the first step and the parameters of the structural model in the second step. Rosseel and Loh claimed that {SAM} is more robust to local model misspecifications (i.e., cross loadings and residual correlations) than one-step maximum likelihood estimation. In this article, it is demonstrated with analytical derivations and simulation studies that {SAM} is generally not more robust to misspecifications than one-step estimation approaches. Alternative estimation methods are proposed that provide more robustness to misspecifications. {SAM} suffers from finite-sample bias that depends on the size of factor reliability and factor correlations. A bootstrap-bias-corrected {LSAM} estimate provides less biased estimates in finite samples. Nevertheless, we argue in the discussion section that applied researchers should nevertheless adopt {SAM} because robustness to local misspecifications is an irrelevant property when applying {SAM}. Parameter estimates in a structural model are of interest because intentionally misspecified {SEMs} frequently offer clearly interpretable factors. In contrast, {SEMs} with some empirically driven model modifications will result in biased estimates of the structural parameters because the meaning of factors is unintentionally changed.},

	abstract = {In Structural Equation Modeling ({SEM}), the measurement part and the structural part are typically estimated simultaneously via an iterative Maximum Likelihood ({ML}) procedure. In this study, we compare performance of the standard procedure to the Structural After Measurement ({SAM}) approach, where the structural part is separated from the measurement part. One appealing feature of the latter multistep procedure is that it extends the scope of possible estimators, as now also non-iterative methods from factor-analytic literature can be used to estimate the measurement models. In our simulations, the {SAM} approach outperformed vanilla {SEM} in small to moderate samples (i.e., no convergence issues, no inadmissible solutions, smaller {MSE} values). Notably, this held regardless of the estimator used for the measurement part, with negligible differences between iterative and non-iterative estimators. This may call into question the added value of advanced iterative algorithms over closed-form expressions (which generally require less computational time and resources).},

	abstract = {The factor structure of mental abilities has most often been depicted using a higher-order model. Under this model, general mental ability (g) is placed at the top of a pyramid, with “loading” arrows going from it to the other factors of intelligence, which in turn go to subtest scores. In contrast, under the bifactor model (also known as the nested factors/direct hierarchical model), each subtest score has its own direct loading on g; the non-g factors (e.g., the broad abilities) do not mediate the relationships of the subtest scores with g. Here we summarized past research that compared the fit of higher-order and bifactor models using confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}). We also analyzed additional archival datasets to compare the fit of the two models. Using a total database consisting of 31 test batteries, 58 datasets, and 1,712,509 test takers, we found stronger support for a bifactor model of g than for the traditional higher-order model. Across 166 comparisons, the bifactor model had median increases of 0.076 for the Comparative Fit Index ({CFI}), 0.083 for the Tucker-Lewis Index ({TLI}), and 0.078 for the Normed Fit Index ({NFI}) and decreases of 0.028 for the root mean square error of approximation ({RMSEA}) and 1343 for the Akaike Information Criterion ({AIC}). Consequently, researchers should consider using bifactor models when conducting {CFAs}. The bifactor model also makes the unique contributions of g and the broad abilities to subtest scores more salient to test users.},

	abstract = {In the highly anticipated Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Thinking, Fast and Slow will transform the way you think about thinking. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

Yet when it comes to structural equation models ({SEMs}), we use estimators that assume true models (e.g. maximum likelihood) and that can create biased estimates when the model is inexact. This article presents an overview of the Model Implied Instrumental Variable ({MIIV}) approach to {SEMs} from Bollen (1996). The {MIIV} estimator using Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS), {MIIV}-2SLS, has greater robustness to structural misspecifications than system wide estimators. In addition, the {MIIV}-2SLS estimator is asymptotically distribution free. Furthermore, {MIIV}-2SLS has equation-based overidentification tests that can help pinpoint misspecifications. Beyond these features, the {MIIV} approach has other desirable qualities. {MIIV} methods apply to higher order factor analyses, categorical measures, growth curve models, dynamic factor analysis, and nonlinear latent variables. Finally, {MIIV}-2SLS permits researchers to estimate and test only the latent variable model or any other subset of equations. In addition, other {MIIV} estimators beyond 2SLS are available. Despite these promising features, research is needed to better understand its performance under a variety of conditions that represent empirical applications. Empirical and simulation examples in the article illustrate the {MIIV} orientation to {SEMs} and highlight an R package {MIIVsem} that implements {MIIV}-2SLS.},

In the last decades, several theories have suggested different accounts for these relationships. These theories have developed in parallel, with little to no cross-talk among them. To advance research on consciousness, we established an adversarial collaboration between proponents of two of the major theories in the field, Global Neuronal Workspace and Integrated Information Theory. Together, we devised and preregistered two experiments that test contrasting predictions of these theories concerning the location and timing of correlates of visual consciousness, which have been endorsed by the theories' proponents. Predicted outcomes should either support, refute, or challenge these theories. Six theory-impartial laboratories will follow the study protocol specified here, using three complementary methods: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({fMRI}), Magneto-Electroencephalography (M-{EEG}), and intracranial electroencephalography ({iEEG}). The study protocol will include built-in replications, both between labs and within datasets. Through this ambitious undertaking, we hope to provide decisive evidence in favor or against the two theories and clarify the footprints of conscious visual perception in the human brain, while also providing an innovative model of large-scale, collaborative, and open science practice.},

	abstract = {Small sample structural equation modeling ({SEM}) may exhibit serious estimation problems, such as failure to converge, inadmissible solutions, and unstable parameter estimates. A vast literature has compared the performance of different solutions for small sample {SEM} in contrast to unconstrained maximum likelihood ({ML}) estimation. Less is known, however, on the gains and pitfalls of different solutions in contrast to each other. Focusing on three current solutions—constrained {ML}, Bayesian methods using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, and fixed reliability single indicator ({SI}) approaches—we bridge this gap. When doing so, we evaluate the potential and boundaries of different parameterizations, constraints, and weakly informative prior distributions for improving the quality of the estimation procedure and stabilizing parameter estimates. The performance of all approaches is compared in a simulation study. Under conditions with low reliabilities, Bayesian methods without additional prior information by far outperform constrained {ML} in terms of accuracy of parameter estimates as well as the worst-performing fixed reliability {SI} approach and do not perform worse than the best-performing fixed reliability {SI} approach. Under conditions with high reliabilities, constrained {ML} shows good performance. Both constrained {ML} and Bayesian methods exhibit conservative to acceptable Type I error rates. Fixed reliability {SI} approaches are prone to undercoverage and severe inflation of Type I error rates. Stabilizing effects on Bayesian parameter estimates can be achieved even with mildly incorrect prior information. In an empirical example, we illustrate the practical importance of carefully choosing the method of analysis for small sample {SEM}. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2023 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}With small to modest sample sizes and complex models, maximum likelihood ({ML}) estimation of confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}) models can show serious estimation problems such as non-convergence or parameter estimates outside the admissible parameter space. In this article, we distinguish different Bayesian estimators that can be used to stabilize the parameter estimates of a {CFA}: the mode of the joint posterior distribution that is obtained from penalized maximum likelihood ({PML}) estimation, and the mean ({EAP}), median (Med), or mode ({MAP}) of the marginal posterior distribution that are calculated by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) methods. In two simulation studies, we evaluated the performance of the Bayesian estimators from a frequentist point of view. The results show that the {EAP} produced more accurate estimates of the latent correlation in many conditions and outperformed the other Bayesian estimators in terms of root mean squared error ({RMSE}). We also argue that it is often advantageous to choose a parameterization in which the main parameters of interest are bounded, and we suggest the four-parameter beta distribution as a prior distribution for loadings and correlations. Using simulated data, we show that selecting weakly informative four-parameter beta priors can further stabilize parameter estimates, even in cases when the priors were mildly misspecified. Finally, we derive recommendations and propose directions for further research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
