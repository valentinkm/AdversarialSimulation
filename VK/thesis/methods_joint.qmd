After collaborating based on the individual studies conducted by Kosanke and my individually conducted studies 

After examining the studies conducted by Kosanke and study 1 and 2 we did not jointly arrive at the conclusion that a collaborative simulation study is warrented (see Discussion for more detail).


The third study was conducted as a result of the collaboration with Kosanke and the respective studies conducted. However I identified several arguments for setting up another simulation. Firstly, to test and evaluate the viability and technical fesability of AC for simulation studies, setting up a study based on the individual studies, their results and with Kosanke can provide valuable

### Aims, objectives and research questions

Following our framework for collaboration the research question for the joint study 

### Population Models and Data Generation Mechanisms


**Study 3**

As in study 1 and 2 data for study 3 was generated based on a 5-factor population structural model with 3 indicators for each factor. Factor loadings and indicator reliability was computed in the same way as in study 1. Two different population models were simulated that resulted in misspecifications of either omitted crossloadings (model 3.1) or omitted correlated residuals (model 3.2). The population-level values of the structural parameters were set to 0.1. Reliability levels were manipulated as in Study 1. The omitted crossloadings (see figure 7) could either be all positive or negative and were set to be 10% lower in absolute values than the factor loadings. Correlated residuals were also either all positive or all negative and were set to not exceed a factor of 0.6 of the residual variances of the indicators.
