All files this thesis and the simulation is based on are hosted on GitHub in the [Adversarial Simulation](https://github.com/valentinkm/AdversarialSimulation) repository.
The `VK/thesis` subdirectory contains all files generating the thesis by Kriegmair using simulation study results data from the `VK/simulation/results` directory and is viewable [here](https://valentinkm.github.io/AdversarialSimulation/thesis/thesis.pdf). The rendering of the thesis (including data visualization) is managed using Docker [@merkel2014docker] and `renv` [@kevin_renv_2024] with the `VK/thesis/renv.lock` file and can be replicated [here](https://github.com/valentinkm/AdversarialSimulation/actions/workflows/publish-thesis.yml) with a click on "Run workflow". Alternatively, with R (v. 4.4 and [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) installed) use the following command inside the cloned repository to render the thesis locally:

```bash
cd VK/thesis
make
```

The `VK/simulation/results` directory contains all processed results of the simulations conducted by Collaborator A (Kriegmair). Results and reproducibility instructions of the studies conducted by Collaborator B (Kosanke) are available in the same repository in the `LK` subdirectory. For preprocessed (large) results files, please contact the authors directly as they exceed the GitHub LFS free storage limit.

The `VK/simulation` subdirectory contains the source code and Docker setup to replicate the studies conducted in the Adversarial Simulation by Collaborator A. A simple minimal proof of reproducibility (with two repetitions) can be triggered via a designated GitHub action [here](https://github.com/valentinkm/AdversarialSimulation/actions/workflows/simulation.yml), press "Run workflow" and view the results on a new pull request after about 20 Minutes. For a local replication use the following instructions:

1. Prerequisites: Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. You can download and install Docker [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. Clone the Repository: In your command line or terminal, clone the [Adversarial Simulation](https://github.com/valentinkm/AdversarialSimulation) repository to your local machine and navigate to the simulation directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/valentinkm/adversarial-simulation.git
    ```
3. Inside the cloned repository build and run the simulation in a Docker container:

    ```bash
    cd VK/simulation
    make
    ```

4. Run Simulation in Docker Container:

    ```bash
    make
    ```
    This command will run the individual studies (study 1 & study 2) as well as the "joint" study (study 3) and save the results in the `results_replic/` directory. The default number of replications is set to 2 for each study. 

5. Additional Information: The R environment for the simulation is also managed using `renv` [@kevin_renv_2024], and the exact package versions are recorded in the `VK/simulation/renv.lock` file.
