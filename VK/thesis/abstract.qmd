Monte Carlo simulation studies often face generalizability issues due to researchers degrees of freedom in operationalizing general claims, potentially leading to bias, ambiguity, and conflicting results. Most open science practices may not fully address biases inherent in the design stage of simulation studies. This thesis introduces *Adversarial Simulation* adapting adversarial collaboration from empirical research to simulation studies to reduce bias, enhance rigor, and improve generalizability. As a case study, conflicting findings on the performance of Structural After Measurement (SAM) versus traditional Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were examined. Two collaborators independently replicated prior studies supporting opposing views: one found that SAM outperformed SEM under model misspecifications, especially with small samples and low indicator reliability; the other found that SEM outperformed SAM when negative cross-loadings or residual correlations were omitted. Despite one collaborator withdrawing, a unified simulation study was conducted by the other formally demonstrating the feasability of *Adversarial Simulation*. The joint study revealed that SAM generally offers advantages over SEM, particularly in handling model misspecifications involving both positive and negative omitted cross-loadings and residual correlations. Specifically, SAM demonstrated lower bias and root mean square error in estimating structural parameters, higher convergence rates, and fewer improper solutions compared to SEM under challenging conditions. Constrained SEM methods mitigated some convergence issues but did not fully match SAM's performance. This process demonstrates that adversarial collaboration is a viable approach in simulation studies, effectively reducing ambiguity and possibly bias in design. Despite challenges like increased resource demands and a narrow field of applicability, *Adversarial Simulation* holds promise for enhancing the robustness and transparency of simulation-based statistical research.
